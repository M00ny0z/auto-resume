                  Hello! My name is Emmanuel Munoz but I go by Manny. I was born and raised in 
                  Tacoma, WA by two amazing Colombian immigrants. I am a Computer Science and 
                  Systems student at the University of Washington, Tacoma campus with a passion
                  for education! I am a member of both the latino and gay communities and proud
                  of it! After college, I hope to start my own company in my hometown and support
                  my community. The quote at the top is my personal mantra in life.
